## Education
- B.E., Electronics and Telecommunications | Pune Institute of Computer Technology (_2020-2024_)

## Work Experience
**Research Intern @ Pune Institute of Computer Technology (_02/2023 - 05/2023_)**
(Tensorflow, Neural Networks, Keras, Scikit-Learn, python, pyDICOM)
- Developed a model capable of processing CT Scans to detect Pulmonary Lung nodules, which may develop cancer.
- Trained the model on the CT Scans of around 1,500 Patients and got ~90% accuracy in detecting Pulmonary Lung Nodules

## Projects
### Veritas - Leveraging AI Algorithms for Intelligent Linux File System Optimization
(Ongoing B.E. Project, sponsored by Veritas Technologies LLC)

- This project aims to implement caching systems on XFS storage solutions, primarily in Linux.
- Using AI models to measure file system performance for improving read/write speeds.
- The goal will be to create an intermediary caching layer between the file system and the user, containing frequently accessed files.

### Bird-Call Audio Detection
Tensorflow, Neural Networks, Keras, Python
- The project was made as a part of the "Z by HP" hackathon, organised on Kaggle.
- Trained Deep learning model which detects CapuchinBird calls from a set of .wav audio files containing forest sounds.
